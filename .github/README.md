This repository does not have a README, and it's been sourced from the account's `.github` repo.

For a private account, this needs to live in the `.github` repo inside a new `.github` subdirectory.

Instead of a default readme, one could have a readme displayed on the profile:

* For an org, it's in this same `.github` but is should live in the `profile` subdirectory, not `.github` (and then it's displayed on the profile).
* For an individual account, it should be in the `$USERNAME` repo's root (and then it's displayed on the profile).

The `.github` repo is used for [default community health files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).
